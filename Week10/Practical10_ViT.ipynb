        "\n",
        "The process of tokenization typically involves two main steps:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Converting to numbers: Each unique token is assigned a unique numerical ID. The model then works with these numbers, which are far easier for a computer to process than raw text.\n",
        "\n",
        "By creating a vocabulary of tokens and their corresponding IDs, the tokenizer allows the model to map between the text it \"sees\" and the numerical representations it can learn from.\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided Python code is a script for creating and training a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer, a popular subword tokenization method used in many modern language models. The script is building two separate tokenizers: one for English and one for German."
